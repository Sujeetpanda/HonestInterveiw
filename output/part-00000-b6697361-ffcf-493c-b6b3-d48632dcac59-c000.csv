In order to do this move, we need to settle all of our delinquent debts and move with a clean slate.   My family is my wife, Stacey, our 3 year old daughter, Mackenzie, and our 11 month old son, Noah.   We have a doggie named Dickens, and yes, of course, he's family.  It will cost us a few thousand to relocated with a moving company.  We need payment to rent an apartment and security, etc.    I will be starting a new position in North Carolina, so we will be with little pay until my training session ends.  We need to be able to have money for rent and take care of the children's needs for at least a couple months.    Thank you for your kind consideration.

25000.0,2007-10-19,"Greetings!  My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home.  The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we undertook a few small projects to update certain areas and improve certain features (such as improving the airflow for our air conditioner).  We ended up overspending our budget, and ended up putting the excess on our credit cards.  We are looking to consolidate some credit card debt that we incurred in the process of fixing up our new place.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!",679.0,18.9%,922xx,CO,< 1 year,0.0,559.7222222222222

15000.0,2007-11-27,"Nobody ever wants to go in to debt. When I met my husband 4 years ago, I had a few small credit cards that I was able to pay off without much help. I thought I was home free after that.  Well, things change. In late 2004, I was laid off two weeks before Christmas. That same week, we got a $300 gas bill and our only car died. We had no other option but to take out a $5000 line of credit to get a car. I started looking for work right away, but as the months rolled by, we had to turn to the line of credit to live.  Not too long after I was laid off, I found out I was pregnant. We were excited, yet terrified. How would we afford this on one income? I eventually did get a job, but making less than $7 an hour part time didn't do much at all. Our beautiful daughter came into the world on September 13, 2005. Soon after, we got a credit card to transfer some high interest balances and pay off our hospital bill.  For a while, things were okay. We weren't doing great, but we were surviving. Day by day, we sunk further into debt. And then the unthinkable happened- my husband was laid off. We both looked for jobs, but nothing came in for four months.  Another credit card entered the scene, which we essentially lived off of.  Excluding my looming student loans (I graduate in May), our current debt hovers around the $15,000 mark. My school schedule and my husband's work schedule finally allowed me to go back to work in August. Two incomes is better than one, but we're still struggling.  Getting a loan to consolidate everything would be a life saver. We're paying as high as 19% interest on one credit card. With student loan payments in the near future, and wanting to have another baby, it's essential to get our debt paid down.",669.0,32.62%,681xx,NE,< 1 year,0.0,535.9791666666666

We are also expecting another child in February. What we are trying to do is consolidate the debt acrued during the move and buy the essentials for our new arrival. We have managed to buy a crib and dresser, but still need much more! We would also like to put some in savings and be able to buy our 11 year old son a few things for Christmas as well. Normally, we would not have this problem as my wife is a nurse, but she is unable to work right now due to pregnancy complications.

3500.0,2007-12-09,"Good day, I appreciate your consideration of my loan request.   Currently, I work as an independent contractor for the Federal Government, driving for a limousine service which transports Congressmen, Senators and other Government officials around Washington, DC. I am a very trustworthy and honest person with security clearance and have been with this company for almost 2 years. Prior to that, I managed a restaurant for over 20 years.   Purpose of Loan:  If I am fortunate to be granted a loan through LendingClub, I would use the money to pay my son's medical bill.  He has a $2,500 medical bill that I would like to pay off for him.   This is not a loan out of necessity....I am relatively debt free and have few expenses. I recently moved into my son's in-law suite in his home and do not have to pay rent, nor do I have any other living expenses such as utilities, however, I do help out with groceries and other small expenses.   Total Amount Requested: $3500 Monthly Net Income: I earn an average of $3,000/mo. net from my job as a diplomatic chauffeur, not including overtime.   Monthly Expenses BEFORE LendingClub Loan: $1,110  Housing: $ 0  Insurance: $ 110  Car expenses: $ 200  Utilities: $ 0  Phone, cable, internet: $ 0  Food, entertainment: $ 300  Clothing, household expenses $ 100  Credit cards and other loans: $ 150  Other expenses: $ 250   Monthly Expenses AFTER LendingClub Loan: $1,250(includes LendingClub loan payment of $150)   As you can see, I will have $1,800 left from my salary after payment of my LendingClub loan.   I have good credit and take my obligations very seriously.  According to my Experian credit report, my credit score is 712. I pride myself on always making my payments on time & will continue to do so with this LendingClub loan. I have a very clean credit history with NO Delinquencies in the past seven years. Improving my credit score is extremely important to me. I can reassure lenders that their investment in me is very safe. The repayment of my LendingClub loan will be the 1st priority each month, with payments automatically withdrawn from my bank account. I promise to make all my payments on time & never default on this loan. Thank you again for considering my loan request!",684.0,14.7%,200xx,DC,2 years,0.0,449.9375

I am a business owner starting up a personal development and coaching company, but I cannot help others if this does not get taken care of.  Once this loan is completed I will offer free coaching and free access to all of the books I have authored as a bonus.

20000.0,2007-12-12,"This loan is to help pay off a high interest rate credit card and allow us (me and my wife) to save money or to boost the payment of the credit card account.   We both have a stable work at the University and medical center.  I am a very hard worker, and a valuable member of my research laboratory and the University.  My wife also works with me in the same division.  I use to have a good credit score because I make payments on time, every time.  I pay my bills before they are due, but lately, because of the high APR of my credit card, we have been very tight to keep this good history going.  We don�t want to �consolidate� or �settle� our payment, because we want to keep our account history.  There is no intention to fall in the credit �trap� again.  Lowering my APR, we�ll be ok, and in our way to pursue our financial plan.  I�m sure that in a short period of time we�ll pay our debt, and we�ll also be in the position to turn around and help others.
